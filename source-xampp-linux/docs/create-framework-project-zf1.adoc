= Start a New Zend Framework 1 Project

 . Open a new Linux terminal and ensure you are logged in as root.

 . Within your XAMPP installation directory (usually _/opt/lampp_), create a new directory named _apps/_ (if it doesn't already exist). Then, within this new _apps/_ directory, create a directory to hold your Zend Framework application and its related XAMPP configuration files. In this case, call the directory _myapp/_.
+
 cd /opt/lampp
 mkdir apps
 mkdir apps/myapp

 . http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest[Download the latest version of the Zend Framework 1 minimal package] as a ZIP or TGZ archive.

 . Extract the contents of the archive to the _myapp\_ directory. This will produce a _ZendFramework-[x.y]-minimal.zip\_ subdirectory in the _myapp\_ directory. Rename this newly-created subdirectory to _htdocs_. 
+
 cd /opt/lampp/apps/myapp
 tar -xzf /tmp/ZendFramework*.tar.gz
 mv ZendFramework* htdocs
+
NOTE: This new _htdocs_ directory will be the main working directory for your Zend Framework project.

 . Next, within the _myapp/_ directory, create a new _conf/_ subdirectory.
+
 cd /opt/lampp/apps/myapp
 mkdir conf

 .. Within the new _conf/_ subdirectory, use your text editor to create and populate a file named _httpd-prefix.conf_ with the following content:
+
 Alias /myapp/ "/opt/lampp/apps/myapp/htdocs/public/"
 Alias /myapp "/opt/lampp/apps/myapp/htdocs/public"
 Include "/opt/lampp/apps/myapp/conf/httpd-app.conf"

 .. Within the _conf/_ subdirectory, also create and populate a file named _httpd-app.conf_ with the following content:
+
 <Directory /opt/lampp/apps/myapp/htdocs/public>
    Options +FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
 </Directory>

 . Edit the _httpd-xampp.conf_ file in the _etc/extra/_ subdirectory of your XAMPP installation directory and add the following line at the end to include the _httpd-prefix.conf_ created earlier.
+
 Include "/opt/lampp/apps/myapp/conf/httpd-prefix.conf"
+
NOTE: Remember to update the above file and directory paths so that they're valid for your system.

 . Change to the _myapp/htdocs/_ directory and run the following commands to create a new stub project.
+
 /opt/lampp/bin/php bin/zf.php create project .

 . Check that you have a directory structure like this:
+
image::create-framework-project-zf1/image1.png[]

 . Restart the Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.
 
You should be able to access the Zend Framework skeleton application by browsing to http://localhost/myapp. Here's what the default welcome page looks like:

image::create-framework-project-zf1/image2.png[]

You can now begin developing your Zend Framework application by modifying the skeleton application code. For more information, http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/learning.html[refer to the Zend Framework documentation].
