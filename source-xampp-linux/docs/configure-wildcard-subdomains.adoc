= Configure Wildcard-Based Subdomains

 . Open a new Linux terminal and ensure you are logged in as _root_.

 . Change to your XAMPP installation directory (typically, _/opt/lampp_) and open the _httpd.conf_ file in the _etc/_ subdirectory using a text editor.

 . Within the file, find the following line and uncomment it by removing the hash symbol (#) at the beginning of the line.
+
 Include etc/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

 . Open the _httpd-vhosts.conf_ file in the _etc/extra/_ subdirectory of your XAMPP installation directory using a text editor. 

 . Replace the contents of this file with the following directives:

 UseCanonicalName Off
 <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "/opt/lampp/htdocs/"
        ServerName localhost
 </VirtualHost>
 <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAlias *.localhost
        VirtualDocumentRoot "/opt/lampp/htdocs/%1/"
 </VirtualHost>

In this configuration, the first virtual host block configures how requests are handled by default. The second block configures wildcard virtual hosting for subdomains, such that requests for _subdomain.localhost_ are automatically served by the _subdomain/_ directory of the _/opt/lampp/htdocs/_ directory. In particular, notice the %1 placeholder, which matches the subdomain name from the request URL.

 . Restart Apache using the XAMPP control panel for your changes to take effect.

At this point, your wildcard subdomains are configured. You can easily test this by creating two new subdirectories at _/opt/lampp/htdocs/app01/_ and _/opt/lampp/htdocs/app02/_. Within each subdirectory, create a file named _index.html_ and fill it with some sample HTML content. Use different content for each file, so that you can easily distinguish that they're being served from different directories - for example:

 <!-- index.html in app01 directory -->
 <html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
   <h1>Welcome to app01.localhost!</h1>
  </body>
 </html>

 <!-- index.html in app02 directory -->
 <html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
   <h1>Hello from app02.localhost!</h1>
  </body>
 </html>

Since these domains do not actually exist, you also need to map them to the local IP address. Open the file _/etc/hosts_ in a text editor and add the following line to it:

 127.0.0.1           app01.localhost   app02.localhost

TIP: Instead of performing this step for each new subdomain, use a local DNS server like dnsmasq to automatically resolve requests for _*.localhost_ to the local IP address. http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html[Find out more about dnsmasq], and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22313142/wildcard-subdomains-with-dnsmasq[read this Stack Overflow thread for information on how to configure wildcard subdomains with dnsmasq].

At this point, you should be able to enter the URLs http://app01.localhost or http://app02.localhost in your browser's address bar, and you should then see the corresponding HTML page.
