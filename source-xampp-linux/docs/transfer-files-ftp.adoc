= Configure FTP Access

XAMPP includes http://www.proftpd.org/[proFTPD], an open-source FTP server. This makes it easy to transfer files to and from a XAMPP environment using FTP.

To illustrate, assume that you have a simple PHP script named _example.php_ in your home directory containing the following code, that you wish to transfer to the XAMPP server.

 <!-- example.php -->
 <html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <h2><?php echo "Hello. Today is " . date('l'); ?>.</h2>
  </body>
 </html>

To transfer files via the proFTPD server, you first need to configure FTP access rules. Follow these steps.

 . Open a new Linux terminal and ensure you are logged in as root.

 . Create a new group named _ftp_. This group will contain those user accounts allowed to upload files via FTP.
+
 groupadd ftp
+
image::transfer-files-ftp/image1.png[]

 . Add your account (in this example, _susan_) to the new group. Add other users if needed.
+
 usermod -a -G ftp susan
+
image::transfer-files-ftp/image2.png[]

 . Change the ownership and permissions of the _htdocs/_ subdirectory of the XAMPP installation directory (typically, _/opt/lampp_) so that it is writable by the the new _ftp_ group.
+
 cd /opt/lampp
 
 chown root.ftp htdocs
 
 chmod 775 htdocs
+

TIP: If you're using XAMPP in a single-user scenario and there will only be one user transferring files via FTP, you can skip creating a new group and instead simply transfer full ownership of the _htdocs/_ directory to that user. To do this, use a command like _chown susan.susan htdocs_.

 . Ensure that proFTPD is running in the XAMPP control panel.

You can now transfer files to the XAMPP server using the steps below:

 . Start an FTP client and enter connection details as below.
+
 * If you’re connecting to the server from the same system, use "127.0.0.1" as the host address. If you’re connecting from a different system, use the network hostname or IP address of the XAMPP server.  
 * Use "21" as the port.
 * Enter your Linux username and password as your FTP credentials. 
+
Your FTP client should now connect to the server and enter the _/opt/lampp/htdocs/_ directory, which is the default Web server document root.

 . Transfer the file from your home directory to the server using normal FTP transfer conventions. If you’re using a graphical FTP client, you can usually drag and drop the file from one directory to the other. If you’re using a command-line FTP client, you can use the FTP PUT command.

 . Once the file is successfully transferred, you should be able to see it in action by browsing to http://localhost/example.php, as shown below:
