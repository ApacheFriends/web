Begin by creating and populating a new database using the SQLite command-line client, as below:

 . Open a new Linux terminal.

 . Change to the _htdocs/_ subdirectory of your XAMPP installation directory (typically _/opt/lampp_) and create a new SQLite database file named _mydb.sq3_ with the SQLite command-line client:
+
 cd /opt/lampp/htdocs
 /opt/lampp/bin/sqlite3 mydb.sq3
+
You should now see an SQLite prompt, as below:
+

+
NOTE: In case your user privileges don't let you write to the _htdocs/_ sub-directory, prefix your commands with _sudo_.

 . At the _sqlite>_ prompt, create a new table to hold your data. In this example, the table is named items and it contains 3 columns, for item ID, item name and item cost. You can use standard CREATE TABLE syntax to create the table, and you can http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html[learn more about SQLite's built-in datatypes here].

 CREATE TABLE items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, price REAL);

 . Add some data to the new inventory table using INSERT commands, as shown below:

 INSERT INTO items VALUES ('1001', 'Salt', 3.15);
 INSERT INTO items VALUES ('1002', 'Pepper', 2.75);
 INSERT INTO items VALUES ('1003', 'Eggs', 2.00);
 INSERT INTO items VALUES ('1004', 'Bacon', 7.25);
 INSERT INTO items VALUES ('1005', 'Milk', 1.15);
 INSERT INTO items VALUES ('1006', 'Strawberries', 8.73);
 INSERT INTO items VALUES ('1007', 'Cereal', 2.65);

 . You can now also run a SELECT query on the data. For example, the query below returns all items that cost less than $3:
+
 SELECT * FROM items WHERE price < 3.00;
+

 . Once you're done using the database, exit it by typing _.quit_ at the _sqlite>_ prompt.

IMPORTANT: The database file (in this example, _mydb.sq3_) contains all your tables and data, so you should remember to back it up regularly.
