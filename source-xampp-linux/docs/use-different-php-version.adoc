= Use a Different PHP Version

In many cases, you might want to use XAMPP with a different PHP version than the one that comes pre-installed. You might do this to get the benefits of a newer version of PHP, or to reproduce bugs using an earlier version of PHP.

NOTE: This guide assumes that your system includes all necessary compilation tools. If you don't already have this, you can install it easily by running the command _sudo apt-get install build-essential_ or _sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"_ from your Linux terminal.

To use a different version of PHP with XAMPP, follow these steps:

 . Stop your Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.

 . Open a new Linux terminal and ensure you are logged in as _root_.

 . Back up your current XAMPP PHP files, in case you later wish to revert to the previous PHP version. These files are stored in two locations: the _php/_ and _modules/_ subdirectories of your XAMPP installation directory (usually, _/opt/lampp_). You should also back up the _php.ini_ configuration file in the _etc/_ subdirectory.
+
 cd /opt/lampp
 mv /opt/lampp/php /opt/lampp/php.old
 mv /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini.old
 mv /opt/lampp/modules/libphp5.so /opt/lampp/modules/libphp5.so.old

 . Download a source archive of the PHP version that you wish to use from the PHP website, and extract the contents of the compressed archive file to the _/tmp_ directory.

 . Configure and build PHP in the usual manner. When executing the configure script, specify the XAMPP installation directory for the _--prefix_, _--with-apxs2_ and _--with-config-file_ options, together with directives for any other modules you wish to activate. For example, here is a simple example of configuring PHP with only MySQL support:
+
 ./configure --prefix=/opt/lampp --with-apxs2=/opt/lampp/bin/apxs --with-config-file-path=/opt/lampp/etc --with-mysql=mysqlnd
+
Here is an example of a  more complex configuration that activates additional modules:
+
 ./configure --prefix=/opt/lampp --with-apxs2=/opt/lampp/bin/apxs --with-config-file-path=/opt/lampp/etc --with-mysql=mysqlnd --enable-inline-optimization --disable-debug --enable-bcmath --enable-calendar --enable-ctype --enable-ftp --enable-gd-native-ttf --enable-magic-quotes --enable-shmop --disable-sigchild --enable-sysvsem --enable-sysvshm --enable-wddx --with-gdbm=/opt/lampp --with-jpeg-dir=/opt/lampp --with-png-dir=/opt/lampp --with-freetype-dir=/opt/lampp --with-zlib=yes --with-zlib-dir=/opt/lampp --with-openssl=/opt/lampp --with-xsl=/opt/lampp --with-ldap=/opt/lampp --with-gd --with-imap-ssl --with-gettext=/opt/lampp --with-mssql=/opt/lampp --with-sybase-ct=/opt/lampp --with-mysql-sock=/opt/lampp/var/mysql/mysql.sock --with-oci8=shared,instantclient,/opt/lampp/lib/instantclient --with-mcrypt=/opt/lampp --with-mhash=/opt/lampp --enable-sockets --enable-mbstring=all --with-curl=/opt/lampp --enable-mbregex --enable-zend-multibyte --enable-exif --with-bz2=/opt/lampp --with-sqlite=shared,/opt/lampp --with-sqlite3=/opt/lampp --with-libxml-dir=/opt/lampp --enable-soap --enable-pcntl --with-mysqli=mysqlnd  --with-iconv=/opt/lampp --with-pdo-mysql=mysqlnd  --with-pdo-sqlite --with-icu-dir=/opt/lampp --enable-fileinfo --enable-phar --enable-zip --enable-intl
+
Here is an example of what you might see during the configuration process:

+
Once configuration is complete, proceed to build PHP as usual.
+
 make && make install
+
At the end of this step, the new version of PHP should be installed in the _php/_ subdirectory of your XAMPP installation directory, replacing the previous version.
+
NOTE: For more information on how to configure and build PHP on Linux systems, http://php.net/manual/en/install.unix.apache2.php[refer to the PHP manual].

 . Copy the _php.ini-development_ file from the new _php/_ subdirectory to the _etc/_ subdirectory and rename it to _php.ini_. If you prefer to use production settings, you could instead use the _php.ini-production_ file.

 cd /opt/lampp/
 cp php/php.ini-development etc/php.ini

 . Restart your Apache server through the XAMPP control panel for your changes to take effect.

The new version of PHP should now be active. To verify this, browse to the URL http://localhost/xampp/phpinfo.php, which displays the output of the _phpinfo()_ command, and check the version number at the top of the page.
