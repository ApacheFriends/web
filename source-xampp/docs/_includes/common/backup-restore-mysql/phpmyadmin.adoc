== Using phpMyAdmin

XAMPP includes http://www.phpmyadmin.net/[phpMyAdmin], an open-source, browser-based tool for managing MySQL/MariaDB database servers. To backup a MySQL/MariaDB database using phpMyAdmin, follow these steps:

 . Browse to http://localhost/phpMyAdmin or http://127.0.0.1/phpMyAdmin. If required, log in using your database access credentials. On a fresh XAMPP installation without any changes, you can log in as _root_ with a blank password.

 . Select the database to be backed up from the list in the left navigation pane. In this case, we're backing up the WordPress database, which is named _bitnami_wordpress_.

 . On the resulting page, select "Quick" as the export method and "SQL" as the output format. Click "Go" to proceed.

phpMyAdmin will export the database to a text file as a series of SQL statements. Once done, the browser will prompt you to download it to the desktop. This text file is your backup, so store it safely!

At a later point, you may wish to restore the database. To restore the data to a fresh MySQL/MariaDB database using phpMyAdmin, follow these steps:

 . Browse to http://localhost/phpMyAdmin or http://127.0.0.1/phpMyAdmin. If required, log in using your database access credentials. 

 . Select the "New" command in the left navigation pane.

 . On the resulting page, enter a name for the new database (in this case, _myblog_). Select the collation "utf8_general_ci". Click "Create" to create the database.

 . Select the new database from the left navigation pane. In the resulting page, select the "Import" command in the top navigation bar.

 . Click the "Browse..." button and select the backup file created earlier. Click "Go" to proceed.

phpMyAdmin will import the data from the backup file. Once complete, you will see a screen indicating the status of the import.

If you browse the contents of the database, you should now see your original data.

You should now update your application's configuration and point it to your newly-created database. For example, with the Bitnami WordPress module, you will need to edit the _wp-config.php_ file in the _apps\wordpress\htdocs\_ subdirectory of your XAMPP installation directory. Within this file, you will need to update the _DB_NAME_ constant to use the new database name.
