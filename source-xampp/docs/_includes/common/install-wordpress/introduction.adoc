Although you might not have realized this, XAMPP comes with a number of https://www.apachefriends.org/add-ons.html[add-on applications]. These add-ons include https://www.drupal.org/[Drupal], http://www.joomla.org/[Joomla!], https://wordpress.com/[WordPress] and many other popular open source applications.
