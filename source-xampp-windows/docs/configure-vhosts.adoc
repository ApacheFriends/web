= Configure Virtual Hosts

include::{docdir}/_includes/common/configure-vhosts/introduction.adoc[]
This guide walks you through the process of setting up a new virtual host with XAMPP, by creating and configuring an example host named _wordpress.localhost_ for a WordPress installation. It assumes that you have an existing WordPress installation at _C:\xampp\apps\wordpress\htdocs\_ and accessible via the URL http://localhost/wordpress.

TIP: You can install WordPress with just a few clicks using the https://bitnami.com/stack/xampp#wordpress[Bitnami WordPress Module for XAMPP].

Follow the steps below to create a virtual host:

 . Change to your XAMPP installation directory (typically, _C:\xampp_) and open the _httpd-vhosts.conf_ file in the _apache\conf\extra\_ subdirectory using your favourite text editor. 

 . Replace the contents of this file with the following directives:
+
 <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/"
        ServerName localhost
 </VirtualHost>
 <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/apps/wordpress/htdocs"
        ServerName wordpress.localhost
 </VirtualHost>
+

This contains two virtual host configuration blocks:
+
 * The first block is the default or fallback virtual host, which is used for all requests that are not matched by subsequent blocks.
+
 * The second block sets up a virtual host named _wordpress.localhost_. The DocumentRoot directive specifies the directory to be used when serving requests for this virtual host (in this case, the WordPress installation directory), while the ServerName directive specifies the custom domain name for the virtual host.
+
To add more virtual hosts, simply duplicate the second virtual host block and modify the port number, DocumentRoot and ServerName directives as per your requirements. For example, if you want to use SSL with your custom domain name, you can add a new virtual host block for port 443. 
+
TIP: If you plan to have a large number of virtual hosts with very similar configuration, consider using wildcard-based subdomains with your virtual hosts.

 . Restart Apache using the XAMPP control panel for your changes to take effect.

 . At this point, your virtual host is configured. However, if you try browsing to the _wordpress.localhost_ domain, your browser will show a failure notice, since this domain does not exist in reality. To resolve this, it is necessary to map the custom domain to the local IP address. To do this, open the file _C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts_ and add the following line to it:
+
 127.0.0.1           wordpress.localhost
+
image::configure-vhosts/image3.png[]
+
This takes care of mapping the _wordpress.localhost_ domain name to the local machine, which always has the IP address 127.0.0.1.

NOTE: On some versions of Windows, you will not be able to edit the _C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts_ file without administrator privileges. You can edit the file by right-clicking the Notepad icon and selected the "Run as administrator" menu option, then entering administrator credentials (if required) and clicking "OK" or "Yes" to proceed.

At this point, you should be able to enter the URL http://wordpress.localhost in your browser's address bar and see your WordPress installation. Here's an example of what you should see:
