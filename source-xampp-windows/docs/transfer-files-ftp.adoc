= Configure FTP Access

XAMPP includes the server version of https://filezilla-project.org/[FileZilla], an open-source FTP solution. This makes it easy to transfer files to and from a XAMPP environment using FTP.

To illustrate, assume that you have a simple PHP script named _example.php_ on your Windows desktop containing the following code, that you wish to transfer to the XAMPP server.

 <!-- example.php -->
 <html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <h2><?php echo "Hello. Today is " . date('l'); ?>.</h2>
  </body>
 </html>

To transfer files using FTP, you must first configure the FileZilla FTP server. Follow the steps below.

 . Ensure that FileZilla is running.

 . Start the FileZilla administration interface by clicking the "Admin" button in the XAMPP control panel.

You should now arrive at the FileZilla server console.

 . You now need to set up at least one FTP user. To do this, click the "Edit -> Users" menu item. This will bring you to the user management interface.

 . Next, you need to define which folders the user has access to. To do this, click the "Shared folder" sub-item in the left navigation menu.

 . Click the "Add" button and select the _htdocs\_ subdirectory of the XAMPP installation directory as the user's home directory.
+

 . Grant the user all available rights to this directory.
+

 . Click "OK" to save your changes.

 . Use the "File -> Quit" menu item to disconnect from the FileZilla administration interface.

You can now transfer files to the XAMPP server by following the steps below:

 . Launch your FTP client and enter connection details as below.
+
 * If you’re connecting to the server from the same system, use "127.0.0.1" as the host address. If you’re connecting from a different system, use the network hostname or IP address of the XAMPP server.  
 * Use "21" as the port.
 * Specify the username and password configured previously as your FTP credentials.
+
Your FTP client should now connect to the server and enter the _C:\xampp\htdocs_ directory, which is the default Web server document root.

 . Transfer the file from your home directory to the server using normal FTP transfer conventions. If you’re using a graphical FTP client, you can usually drag and drop the file from one directory to the other. If you’re using a command-line FTP client, you can use the FTP PUT command.

 . Once the file is successfully transferred, you should be able to see it in action by browsing to http://localhost/example.php, as shown below:
