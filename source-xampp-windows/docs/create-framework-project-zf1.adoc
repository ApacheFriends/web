= Start a New Zend Framework 1 Project

 . http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest[Download the latest version of the Zend Framework 1 minimal package] as a ZIP archive.

 . Within your XAMPP installation directory (usually _C:\xampp_), create a new directory named _apps\_ (if it doesn't already exist). Then, within this new _apps\_ directory, create a directory to hold your Zend Framework application and its related XAMPP configuration files. In this example, call the directory _myapp\_.

 . Extract the contents of the ZIP archive to the _myapp\ directory. This will produce a _ZendFramework-[x.y]-minimal.zip\_ subdirectory in the _myapp_\ directory. Rename this newly-created subdirectory to _htdocs_. 
+
NOTE: This new _htdocs_ directory will be the main working directory for your Zend Framework project.

 . Within the _myapp\_ directory, create a new _conf\_ subdirectory.

 .. Within the new _conf_\ subdirectory, use your text editor to create and populate a file named _ttpd-prefix.conf_ with the following content:

 Alias /myapp/ "C:/xampp/apps/myapp/htdocs/public/"
 Alias /myapp "C:/xampp/apps/myapp/htdocs/public"
 Include "C:/xampp/apps/myapp/conf/httpd-app.conf"

 .. Within the _conf_\ subdirectory, also create and populate a file named _httpd-app.conf_ with the following content:

 <Directory C:/xampp/apps/myapp/htdocs/public>
    Options +FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
 </Directory>

 . Edit the _httpd-xampp.conf_ file in the _apache\conf\extra\_ subdirectory of your XAMPP installation directory and add the following line at the end to include the _httpd-prefix.conf_ file created earlier.
+
 Include "C:/xampp/apps/myapp/conf/httpd-prefix.conf"
+
NOTE: Remember to update the above file and directory paths so that they're valid for your system.

 . Launch a new Windows command shell using the "Shell" button in the XAMPP control panel.

 . Within the command shell, change to the _myapp\htdocs\_ directory and run the following commands to create a new stub project.

 bin\zf.bat create project .

 . Check that you have a directory structure like this:
+
image::create-framework-project-zf1/image1.png[]

 . Restart the Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.

You should be able to access the Zend Framework skeleton application by browsing to http://localhost/myapp. Here's what the default welcome page looks like:

image::create-framework-project-zf1/image2.png[]

You can now begin developing your Zend Framework application by modifying the skeleton application code. For more information, http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/learning.html[refer to the Zend Framework documentation].
