= Increase the PHP File Upload Limit

By default, XAMPP imposes a 128M limit on files uploaded through PHP. To increase the allowed file size for uploads through PHP, follow these steps:

 . Edit the _php.ini_ file in the _xamppfiles/etc/_ subdirectory of your XAMPP installation directory (usually, _/Applications/XAMPP_). Within this file, find the _post_max_size_ and _upload_max_filesize_ variables and change them to reflect the new file upload limit. For example, to restrict uploads to not more than 16M, change these variables as shown below:
+
 ; Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.
 ; http://php.net/post-max-size
 post_max_size=16M
 ...
 ; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
 ; http://php.net/upload-max-filesize
 upload_max_filesize=16M

 . Save your changes to the file.

 . Restart the Apache server.

The new file upload limit will now come into effect.
