== Step 3: Connect your Azure and Bitnami Accounts

****
At the end of this step, your Bitnami Launchpad for Azure will be configured and you will be ready to provision a cloud server.
****

The easiest way to set up your Azure cloud server with LAMP packaged by Bitnami is via the https://azure.bitnami.com/[Bitnami Launchpad for Azure], which gives you a simple control panel to provision, start, stop and check status of your Azure cloud servers. However, to use it, you must first connect your Azure and Bitnami accounts.

To do this:

 * Log in to your Bitnami account if you're not already logged in
 * Browse to https://azure.bitnami.com/
 * Select the "Sign in with Bitnami" link in the top right corner.

The Launchpad will recognize your Bitnami credentials and automatically sign you in.

The next step is to set up an administrative password for the Bitnami Launchpad and connect your Azure account with your Bitnami account.

Select "Virtual Machines" in the Launchpad menu and - since this is your first time - you'll be prompted to enter an administrative password.

The administrative password offers an additional level of protection against misuse: you'll need to enter it when performing certain operations, such as creating new Azure server instances. Again, make sure you note it down for future reference.

Next, you'll be asked to connect your Azure account to your Bitnami account, by transferring a management certificate generated by Azure into your Launchpad account. Although this sounds complex, the Launchpad makes this a simple two-step process.

 * Select the "Create a Management Certificate for Microsoft Azure" button. So long as you're still logged in to Azure, this will generate a .publishsettings file which you'll be prompted to download through your browser.

 * Once the file is downloaded, drag it from your desktop to the Bitnami Launchpad page and then select the "Create Service" option to upload the management certificate to the Launchpad.

Your Azure and Bitnami accounts will now be connected.
