== Step 1: Register with Google Cloud Platform

****
At the end of this step, you will have signed up for the Google Cloud Platform free trial.
****

Begin by creating a Google Cloud Platform account, by browsing to https://cloud.google.com/[https://cloud.google.com/] and choosing the "Start your free trial" option. You will need an existing Google account to log in and sign up for the free trial; if you don't have one, you can https://accounts.google.com/SignUp[create one here] (remember to keep track of your account username and password, because you'll need them in the next step).

Once you've signed in, provide Google with some personal information and your credit card details.

It's important to note that you're signing up for a free trial and your credit card won't be billed unless you migrate to a paid account. The trial includes $300 of free credit, valid for 60 days. Once the trial ends, your account will automatically be paused and you'll only be charged if you explicitly choose to upgrade to a paid account.

The Google elves will go away for a minute or so to verify your information and if all is well, you will be redirected to the https://developers.google.com/console[Google Developers Console], which allows you to manage your billing account, create new projects and get support. You should see that your free trial is now active in the billing credits section.

You should also receive an account confirmation email, which tells you that your account is good to go.

Bitnami uses the Google Compute Engine API in order to manage and launch cloud servers, so this is a good time to enable the API. Plus, new cloud servers always launch within a project, so you'll also need to create a project. Both these tasks are easy to do from the Google Developers Console. Follow these steps:

 * While you're logged in to the Google Developers Console, select the "Projects" menu item and click the "Create Project" button.  
 * Enter a name for the project (such as "My Bitnami Project") and make a note of the auto-generated project ID.

 * Click "Create" to create and activate the project. You should now see it in the project listing.

 * Select the new project name in the project listing, and you'll be transferred to the project information page.
 * Select the "APIs" menu item in the left navigation bar.
 * Look through the list of APIs, or use the API search box to search for the term "compute engine". Find and turn on the Google Compute Engine API.
