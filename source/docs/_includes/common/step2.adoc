== Step 2: Register with Bitnami

****
At the end of this step, you will have created a Bitnami account.

The next step is to create a Bitnami account, so that you can launch a cloud server with LAMP packaged by Bitnami image. If you have a Google, Microsoft or Github account, you can use your credentials from those services with Oauth to create your Bitnami account.

If you don't have accounts with those services (or you don't want to use them), you can use your email address and password to create a Bitnami account, as described below:

 * Head to https://bitnami.com/account/sign_up[the Bitnami sign-up page].
 * Enter your name and email address.
 * Choose a password.
 * Review and agree to the Bitnami terms of service.

Then, use the "Sign up" button to create your account.

Bitnami will send you an email with a verification link which you'll need to click or browse to, to activate your account. This will also sign you in to your Bitnami account.
