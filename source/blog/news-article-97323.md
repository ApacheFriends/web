With many other open source projects - like our friends from phpMyAdmin - we're showcasing our software at this year's DotOrg-Pavilion (open April 24th and 25th) and will be happy to talk to you about the past, the present and the future of XAMPP.

The MySQL Conference & Expo is taking place in Santa Clara, April 23-26, and it's not too late to qualify for the early bird discount: If you take advantage of early registration by March 14th you can save $200 off the standard conference fee.
