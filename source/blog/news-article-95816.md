During the last days and weeks new releases of PHP  (4.4.5 and 5.2.1), a new version of MySQL (5.0.33), and a new Apache (2.2.4) saw the light of the day. We're currently working on the new XAMPP version and invite you to take a closer look at the beta versions of the next XAMPP release:

XAMPP BETA versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!
