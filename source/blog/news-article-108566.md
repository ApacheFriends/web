Sorry, the MySQL conference in Japan and my vacation came up, but now we're finally ready to annouce the next (and hopefully last) beta of the next XAMPP release. 

New in this beta are: PHP5 (5.2.4), Apache (2.2.6), phpMyAdmin (2.11.1), and eAccelerator (0.9.5.2). 

XAMPP beta versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!
