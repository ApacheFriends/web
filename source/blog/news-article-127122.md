The summer is over, but as a small consolation there is a new version of XAMPP. And this time, we were able to update all existing four XAMPP versions.

In this version we updated:  MySQL (5.0.67), PHP (4.4.9), and phpMyAdmin (2.11.9.2).  The Solaris version even got a total of 14 packages updated.

Get the downloads and more details on the specific platforms [XAMPP project page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
