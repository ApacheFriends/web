The last week big news hung in air: the long awaited MySQL 5 came as a GA (Generally Available) version out. After a week beta phase (thanks to all testers) we now can announce the first "final" version of XAMPP containing the new MySQL to the public: XAMPP for Linux 1.5!

Also new in this version of XAMPP: upgraded version of Apache (2.0.55), PHP (4.4.1), phpMyAdmin (2.6.4-pl3) and OpenSSL (0.9.8a). 

Appropriate versions for Windows and Mac OS X follow in the next days.
