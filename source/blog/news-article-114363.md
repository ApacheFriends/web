And again we're on our mission to keep XAMPP up-to-date and put the first beta version of the upcoming XAMPP release in our public beta download area. 

New in this beta are: Apache (2.2.8), PHP4 (4.4.8 on Linux and on Windows 4.4.8RC2), Perl (5.10.0), phpMyAdmin (2.11.4), and FileZilla FTP Server (0.9.25) in the Windows version of XAMPP. 

XAMPP beta versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!
