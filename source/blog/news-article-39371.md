During the last week two new releases of PHP  (4.3.10 and 5.0.3) and a new version of MySQL (4.1.8) saw the light of the day. We're now setting the new XAMPP versions together and would like you to take a look at the beta versions of the next XAMPP releases:

XAMPP BETA versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!
