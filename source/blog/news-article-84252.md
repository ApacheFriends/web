The (probably and hopefully) last beta versions of XAMPP for Windows and Linux are available for public download in our  [XAMPP BETA area](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-beta.html). New in this version are: Apache 2.2.3, MySQL 5.0.24a, PHP 4.4.4 and 5.1.6, and phpMyAdmin 2.8.2.4. 

Beta releases are only for testing purposes. We would very much appreciate it if you could test this release and let us know if you run into any problems. 

If no problems are found the final version will follow this weekend.
