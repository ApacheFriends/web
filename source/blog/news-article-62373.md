New versions of MySQL and PHP motivated us again to build new versions of XAMPP. First of all we now could announce the release of an up-to-date BETA of the Linux version of XAMPP.

New in this BETA: MySQL (5.0.16), DIO support for PHP5, phpMyAdmin (2.6.4-pl4) and PHP (5.1.0). Warning: eAccelerator currently doesn't support PHP 5.1.
