Again and again the guys from Apache, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin and finally from OpenSSL surprised us over the last weeks with new releases of their software packages. Now after a very quiet week we are proud to announce our own new version containing all these new releases.

New in this version of XAMPP are: Apache (2.2.3), MySQL (5.0.24a), phpMyAdmin (2.8.2.4), PHP (4.4.4 and 5.1.6) and OpenSSL (0.9.8c).

In case of Windows we also upgraded ADOdb (4.91) and FileZilla FTP Server (0.9.18).
