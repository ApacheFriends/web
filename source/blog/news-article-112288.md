Two of XAMPP's four main components were updated within the last few days and now we're ready with the first beta version of the next XAMPP release.

New in this beta are: PHP5 (5.2.5), MySQL (5.0.51), phpMyAdmin (2.11.3), and some Windows-specific packages in the Windows version of XAMPP. 

XAMPP beta versions are always for testing purposes only. There will be no upgrade packages from and to beta versions. To all testers: Many thanks in advance!!
