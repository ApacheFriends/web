After the new version for Linux we are now also able to announce a fixed version of XAMPP for Windows.

Some vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and compromise a vulnerable system. To fix this problem we released an upgrade package for the Windows version of XAMPP.

This upgrade is primary for those people who a using XAMPP in a public or semi public environment, like a local network or the Internet.

You can get the upgrade from the [here](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html:3ptkivpf]usual place[/url:3ptkivpf] (there you also find an explanation how to install the upgrade). More information about the vulnerability: [url=http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20060928.txt)
