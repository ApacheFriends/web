We are planning to redesign the demo pages for one of the next releases of XAMPP. Our demo pages are six years old by now and are screaming for an update. 

To make sure that we are not just following our personal preferences, we are now looking for [volunteers](http://www.a-kunkel.de/usability/umfrage_en.php) for our usability survey.

Thank you for taking part and special thanks to Karin Kunkel, Sonja Uhl and Constanze Weiland, who are carrying out this survey for us.
