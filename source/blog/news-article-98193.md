In May 2007 XAMPP will be five years old and we think this is a good time to think about changes and improvements to XAMPP. That's what this survey is for: to find out what your needs are and what we can do to improve XAMPP in the next major release.

The survey will run for exactly one month (from March 22nd to April 22nd 2007), after which we will publish the results right here.

Thank you for taking the time to complete the survey. We appreciate your feedback and we will use it to make XAMPP even more useful and enjoyable. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

If there are any questions you don't want to answer, you don't have to. You choose.
